                <h3>What is Coding</h3>
                <p>Coding is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites, and software. Without it,
                    we’d have none of the most popular technology we’ve come to rely on such as Facebook, our
                    smartphones, the browser we choose to view our favorite blogs, or even the blogs themselves. It all
                    runs on code.</p>
                <h3>How Coding Works</h3>
                <p>To put it very simply, the code is what tells your computer what to do. To go a bit deeper, computers
                    don’t understand words. They only understand the concepts of on and off. The capabilities of a
                    computer are guided by on and off switches, or transistors. Binary code represents these on and off
                    transistors as the digits 1 and 0. An infinite number of combinations of these codes make your
                    computer work. In order to make binary code manageable, computer programming languages were formed.
                    These languages each serve different purposes, but they all allow programmers to translate important
                    commands into binary code.</p>
                <p>
                    Each computer application needs a properly written code to know what to do. Most software has
                    thousands to billions of lines of coded text and numbers. The code gives computers a step-by-step
                    guide on how to function. Computers speed through reading the code to execute every online and
                    offline task. In today’s digital world, everything from mobile phones to smart TVs and cars run
                    using coded software. For example, the code might tell the computer to input an image and make it
                    spin. Creating flawless code is essential to avoid 404 error pop-ups and software crashes. Debugging
                    code is always the final step to reveal and fix coding issues
